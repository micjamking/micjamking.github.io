## Hello World
I'm Mike King, a designer & developer residing in Honolulu, Hawaii. My passion is assisting brands with telling their story across the digital landscape. For the past decade I've been developing my craft as a user experience designer and web developer in a high-paced agency environment, operating as a generalist to continually expand my knowledge and skill-set in keeping with the rapid pace and change of technology. My aim is to provide clients with streamlined, end-to-end creative solutions that match their digital & technical challenges.

## Experience
For the past decade, I've worked on a wide variety of digital projects from a diverse clientele with various technical challenges; WordPress-driven marketing and eCommerce sites, hospitality kiosks running Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), data-driven HTML5 / JavaScript applications with custom interactive data-visualizations and charting, native (Android - XML / Java; iOS - Objective-C / Swift) as well as hybrid (HTML5 / Cordova) mobile applications for the Hawaii travel and tourism industry. I love learning new, cutting edge technologies and providing solutions for clients that span a variety of touchpoints, across web, mobile and desktop environments.

_VP, Interactive Design, January 2011 to Present_

_Owner, Web & Graphic Designer, January 2009 to May 2011_

Prior to joining an agency, I operated my own web and graphic design freelance business. I focused on graphic design as well as web design and WordPress development.

## Education
I’ve spent 2 years studying graphic design in college and have taken several computer science courses (C, C++) since high school, however I would describe myself as mostly self-taught and trained ‘on-the-job’ in the areas of interactive design and web development. Web design and development has always been a hobby of mine, and I’m thankful that it has grown into a successful career over years.
