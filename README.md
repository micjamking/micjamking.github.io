## Prerequisites

At a minimum, you will need the following tools installed:

1. [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
2. [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Grow](https://grow.io)

If you do not have Grow, you can install it using:

```

## Running the development server

```
$ npm start
```

## Building

You can use the `npm run build` command to build your whole site to the `build` directory. This is a good way to test and verify the generated code.

```
$ npm run build
```

## Backup/Deploying

```
$ npm run backup
$ npm run deploy
```
