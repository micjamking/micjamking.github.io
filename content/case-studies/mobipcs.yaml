      - "Due to their lower than normal pricing, the brand was also actively fighting the stigma of being the “cheap phone guys” and only servicing low income customers. The previous website featured a legacy, fixed-width design (ie. no mobile support) and included multiple pain points in their product purchase and bill-payment user flows."
      - "Additionally, the client was also interested in expanding the “self-care” portion of the site, allowing users to perform common account-level tasks online (ie. bill payment, upgrade their phone, add a new line/phone number, etc.)."

Increasing online sales wasn’t a major concern because they were well known for their in-store customer service and wanted to maintain that human touch in the sales process.'

        - "60&#37; of their target audience made above the median-household income for the state of Hawaii, directly contradicting the stigma placed on them for being a cheap carrier for low-income individuals"
        - "Over 70&#37; of current customers at the time used their smartphone as their primary device for accessing the internet."

Using <span class='bold'>AngularJS + Foundation Framework</span>, I was able to quickly put together a testable, interactive prototype allowing test users to create Ohana (family) plans with multiple phone lines, plan options and add-ons, and devices, from browse to checkout."
