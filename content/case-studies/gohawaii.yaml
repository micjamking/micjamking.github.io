          - "We performed a <span class='bold'>competitor analysis</span> across 9 different local and national competitors in the travel and tourism space. Additionally, we created <span class='bold'>user profiles</span> to define the audience of the application, extrapolated from market research performed by the client."

        - "This finding influenced our creative strategy and subsequently, the branding and visual design for the application."
        - "In Japanese culture, the concept of “cute” or “cuteness” permeates many products, and is used as design strategy to create an emotional impact with customers."
        - "Leaning on this discovery, we created a set of “cute” character guides for the mobile application to help guide users safely on their journey through the islands."

        body:
          - "One of the primary challenges for the project was defining a <span class='bold'>creative strategy</span> that could make safety information exciting and interesting for visitors to the islands."
          - "Based on the business requirements and potential motivations of the target audience, I presented two creative design strategies for the mobile experience: a conservative, content-centric brochure experience that used animations and transitions as supporting elements of the design, and an interactive narrative experience that uses storytelling and illustrations to escort users through the content, using animated characters as friendly guides."
          - "As the client’s concern was making the safety content more accessible and digestible, they chose to pursue the interactive storytelling direction. From here, I collaborated with our art director and visual designers to ensure the brand and user interface designs created the right narrative experience for first time visitors to the islands."

        body:
          - "Once the information architecture had been agreed upon, I shifted my focus to the <span class='bold'>technical architecture</span> of the system. Based on the requirements of the project, we needed to develop a system that would allow for managing and serving content from 6 different locales while allowing the user to dynamically switch languages within the mobile app and the client to update the content in any language on the fly. "
          - "We decided to use a Headless WordPress CMS as the backend, and through a combined usage of localization plugins, custom fields / custom post type development, and WordPress’ new built-in REST API, we were able to develop a seamless editorial workflow that allowed HTA’s local and international marketing teams to add and update content within the mobile app without pushing new versions to the app store."

      body: 'In the end, we successfully created the state of Hawaii’s first official travel and tourism app; a fun and interactive way to learn both safety and historical information about the Hawaiian Islands. The client had a goal of achieving 10,000 downloads by the annual Hawaii Tourism Conference, 3 months after launch. We were happily surprised when we had reached more than 15,000 downloads several weeks ahead of the conference. Additionally, the mobile application design won a 2017 Pele Gold award for best mobile app. The annual competition, formerly known as the ADDYs, recognizes the best advertising and design work in Hawaii.'
