  component: section_process
  string: For the initial Discovery process, I had several one-on-one meetings with the founder to <span class='bold'>define the goals and scope</span> of the project. Given this was a new startup, we needed to breakdown the scope into multiple phases to make the project more manageable.
  type: phase_1_body_1
section_process_phase_1_body_2:
  component: section_process
  string: Once we had a clear understanding of the scope, we began diving into the <span class='bold'>user research</span> the founder had collected over time. We defined <span class='bold'>user profiles</span> around their technical web skill level, motivations & goals, and business types, which we later used as guidelines for the types of packaged reports available within the web application.

  string: For an application of this complexity, I followed an <span class='bold'>object-oriented design pattern</span> and designed components that would build up the user interface in layers. This allowed for UI components to be reused across the different areas of the application and established a common language for the interface.

  component: section_process
  string: Given the application’s user interface primary function was to visualize data, we also spent a considerable amount of focus on <span class='bold'>defining how to visualize that data</span>. We worked with a data scientist to help analyze sample data sets from website analytics and based on our defined reports, determine the appropriate visualizations that would present the data correctly and allow for deeper exploration.
